# Linear-Multivariable-Regression
To establish a relation between the dependent variable Y and a 5-tuple of independent variables X1, X2, X3, X4 and X5

# PROJECT TITLE: Multivariate Linear Regression Project

## DESCRIPTION:
<br>The objective of this project is to develop a linear multivariable regression to establish a relation
between the dependent variable Y and a 5-tuple of independent variables X1, X2, X3, X4 and X5.</br>

## DATASET:
<br>The dataset used in this project has 5 tuple feature set(X1,X2,X3,X4,X5) which are the independent variables and the dependent variable (Y) is the output variable </br>
